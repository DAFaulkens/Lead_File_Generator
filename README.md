<b><u>Publishing Details</u></b><br>
<b>Program Name:</b> Lead File Generator<br>
<b>Created Under:</b> Tkinter<br>
<b>From:</b> Gautam Walve

<b>Description of the Application:</b><br>
Being Working in an organisation where cold leads are generated on a daily baisis.<br>
This module works towards solving that issue, to an extent.
This module takes in Basis Information required in establishing contact with the client like Name, Number, Email, sourcing method, sourced file of which loan type,
wether the customer wants to be followed or not and the date for follow up.
it has also has a check for checking number digit valid for your region.<br>
<b>Basis the Input it creates a CSV File with Today's Date which would help to daily tracking of leads generated, this point is still up for Debate as there is already a method kept in place to Track it by the date..</b>

<b>What to Expect:</b><br>
When the Application is run, it will take in Input which will create the file where-ever the executable is placed, 
with the opinion of having a portable version for the easy transition, due to company wide restricted policies.<br>
This module should help in generating a plethora of Database for the End User
